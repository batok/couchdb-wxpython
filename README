This is a python GUI multiplatform program.

Purpose:

Store and retrieve blog data into a couchdb engine.
This is not a web application , it's a desktop one (GUI).
The program can create the couchdb database and document views.
A nice feature is that you can attach a screenshot ( or screenshot series ) to any blog post.


Requirements:

Python 2.6 
wxpython 2.8.9.1 or +
couchdb-python ( installation via ... easy_install CouchDB ).
An Apache Couchdb 0.10 engine installed in the same same computer or accesible via network ( a ssh tunel is a good approach ).
I have used couchdb in Ubuntu 9.10.  It's available via sudo apt-get install couchdb-bin


Tested in:

Windows XP and Vista.
Linux.
Mac OS X Panther, Tiger and Leopard.

Run:

You can run it from the shell ( cmd.exe in windows ) with

python couchdbgui.py

(prepend to python interpreter the full path if it's not set in PATH environment variable ).

Another way to run it is using the new from zip file feature in python 2.6.

First make a zip from couchdbgui.py and __main__.py file.

In a nix system this can be accomplished by...

zip foo.pyz couchdbgui.py __main__.py
python foo.pyz 

You can call your zip file ( and extension ) whatever you want.
